Current problem: the beam divergence is 0.1mrad which is very small compared to the angles subtended by the sensor at the initial location of the beam particle. However, in most events the incoming electron doesn't even hit the sensor. Not sure why that is. Check run 1 and run 2 folders for different beam_divergence settings.

After fixing that, try to get the 6째 setup working - the angle between the normal to the detector surface and the beam direction should be 90째 - 6째 = 84째. The data that we meant to compare the simulation results against is given in the measurement_data subdirectory. All the files with "G10" in the name refer to the data which was taken with a block of G10 material placed in front of the sensor. If there is a way to place insensitive material in front of the detector in allpix, this data might come in handy.
